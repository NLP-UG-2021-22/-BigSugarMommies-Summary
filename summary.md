### 2.1 How Human Produce Speech

Acoustic phonetics studies the physical, acoustic properties of the sound waves that we produce. It's concerned with how we use our bodies to produce speech sounds. Producing speech needs three mechanisms:
- the first is a source of energy: air from the lungs- **respiration**
- the second is the sound produced by vocal folds at the larynx -**phonation** 
- the third the sound is shaped by the _articulators_ - **articulation**.

When we speak, we make some sounds with vocal folds open and vibrating.

### 2.2 Articulators

Humans produce speech by pulling air from the lungs down the larynx, where the vocal folds may or may not vibrate, but we also shape airflow with our lips and teeth. The sound of the vowel alters if you produce the sound _"aaah"_ and then circle your lips, and you can even utilize your lips to totally stop the flow of air, as in the consonants **[b]** and **[p]**. Although there aren't many palatal sounds in English, we do move the tongue to the palate for the glide **[j]**. Some people use their tongue near the alveolar ridge to make the sounds **[s]** and **[z]**. If you stick your finger in your mouth and tap the roof of your mouth, you'll notice that it's bony, which is the hard palate.

We get the nasal sounds  when we limit airflow in the mouth but allow air to move through the nasal cavity. Make another _"aaaaa"_ vowel, then nasalize it. Moving the body of the tongue up against the velum, or soft palate, can also impede airflow. The sound output varies depending on how the articulators are configured.vibrating.
