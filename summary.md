## Chapter 1: Thinking Like a Linguist

### 1.1 Linguistics is science

&ensp;This chapter introduces linguistics as **the science of human language**, which involves using scientific approach when asking questions about language. Taking scientific approach means making **[empirical] (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/empirical) observations**. 

&ensp;Importantly, the observations mad about language are not judgements or valuations, which would constitute a prescriptive approach. Linguists, as well as other researchers in various different fields of science, use a **descriptive approach**, which means they describe the ways people use language without valuation whether it is correct or wrong. On the basis of these observations theories re developed of why people communicate the way they do. 

&ensp;Linguistics deals only with human communication, as we have a unique system, unlike other species. The unique aspects include the **articulatory system**: lungs, larynx, vocal folds, tongue, teeth, lips, and nose, which allow us to produce speech. Secondly, the **auditory system** with ears sensitive to the frequencies most common in human speech. And lastly, the **neural system**, which includes a complex and densely connected brain with many connections devoted to producing and understanding language. 

### 1.2 Mental Grammar

&ensp;Linguistics is a subfield of **cognitive science**, which main focus is the representation and organization of language knowledge in the human mind. 

&ensp;In order for speakers of a language to understand each other they need some kind of **shared system**, which allows people to understand each other’s ideas trough speech. This system is called **mental grammar**. Despite the fact that all speakers of all languages share mental grammars, this book is focused on this system of English.  

&ensp;First **sound systems** are discussed, specifically **phonetics** which is a study on how speakers produce specific sounds, and how listeners hear them. Next, **phonology** is considered. It is the organization of sounds in the mind. Then, focus is on **morphology** - study of the formation of meaningful words. **Syntax** is the next aspect worth taking a look at. It deals with combining words into phrases and sentences. Lastly, the discussion shifts towards **semantics**, which is concerned with the organization of the meanings of words and sentences in the mind.

### 1.3 Creativity and Generativity

&ensp;Creativity is one of the most fundamental properties of human language. When language is described as creative, it means that:
1.	it can express any concept,
2.	it can generate an infinite number of words and sentences, despite having a finite set of words, sounds and rules. 

&ensp;Due to its ability to create new words and sentences, human grammar is **generative**. 

### 1.4 Fundamental Properties of Language

&ensp;This chapter deals with fundamental properties of language, which may contradict some of popular misconceptions about languages.

&ensp;Firstly, **all languages have grammar**, so the sounds system, morphology, syntax and semantics. They all have some sort of shared system – mental grammar, even the ones which do not have a written form.

&ensp;Secondly, **all languages are equally valid**. There is no distinction between grammars in the terms of which is better; there is no such ranking. Despite linguists not evaluating languages and dialects this way, sociolinguistics tells us that some may be viewed positively or negatively by certain communities due to a variety of reasons. 

&ensp;Third point, is that despite the many differences between languages, there are some **universal properties**, which are all human languages have in common, such as differentiating between nouns and verbs, or the existence of vowels and consonants. The field of linguistics concerned with these properties is called [**typology**] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_typology). 

&ensp;The next property deals with the fact that all languages **change** over time. Not one language stays exactly the same forever, conversely, it grows along with the society and reflects the social changes. 

&ensp;Lastly, the authors discuss the fact that much of people’s **mental grammar** and knowledge about language **is unconscious**, and cannot be accessed with conscious awareness. Linguistics is thus focused on discovering this hidden knowledge and bringing it to light to further dissect its workings. 

### 1.5 Language Change in Progress

&ensp;This unit focuses on the changes in language, specifically English, that are currently happening. Some changes in language are faster, some slower, and some are more evident than others. Nevertheless, every part of a language’s grammar is prone to changes. Some of the most prominent changes are noticeable in the vocabulary (*beardo*, *awesomesauce*). Changes in the sound system happen more gradually. Syntax and morphology changes happen very slowly compared to the others. The last change discussed is happening in the pronoun system, with the shift from *thou* and *thee* to *you* mentioned, as well as the use of *they* when referring to a group as well as individuals. 


## Chapter 2: Producing Speech Sounds

### 2.1 How Human Produce Speech

&ensp;Acoustic phonetics studies the physical, acoustic properties of the sound waves that we produce. It's concerned with how we use our bodies to produce speech sounds. Producing speech needs three mechanisms:
- the first is a source of energy: air from the lungs- **respiration**
- the second is the sound produced by vocal folds at the larynx -**phonation** 
- the third the sound is shaped by the _articulators_ - **articulation**.

When we speak, we make some sounds with vocal folds open and vibrating.

### 2.2 Articulators

&ensp;Humans produce speech by pulling air from the lungs down the larynx, where the vocal folds may or may not vibrate, but we also shape airflow with our lips and teeth. The sound of the vowel alters if you produce the sound _"aaah"_ and then circle your lips, and you can even utilize your lips to totally stop the flow of air, as in the consonants **[b]** and **[p]**. Although there aren't many palatal sounds in English, we do move the tongue to the palate for the glide **[j]**. Some people use their tongue near the alveolar ridge to make the sounds **[s]** and **[z]**. If you stick your finger in your mouth and tap the roof of your mouth, you'll notice that it's bony, which is the hard palate.

&ensp;We get the nasal sounds  when we limit airflow in the mouth but allow air to move through the nasal cavity. Make another _"aaaaa"_ vowel, then nasalize it. Moving the body of the tongue up against the velum, or soft palate, can also impede airflow. The sound output varies depending on how the articulators are configured.vibrating.


### 2.3 Describing Speech Sounds: the IPA

&ensp;Over a century ago, the International Phonetic Alphabet, or IPA, was formed. Linguists utilize the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) to transcribe speech sounds from all languages. There is no uncertainty about which sound a given sign relates to, unlike English spelling. Each symbol corresponds to a single sound, and each sound corresponds to a single symbol.

&ensp;Each symbol represents one sound, and each sound is represented by one symbol. Every transcription is framed by square brackets.


### 2.4 IPA symbols and speech sounds

&ensp;This chapter shows IPA symbols and speech sounds, for each symbol there is an example of a word in which this sound occurs. The examples are here to make all the symbols easier to understand.  


### 2.5 Sonority, Consonants, and Vowels

&ensp;In phonetics sounds are categorised based on how they're made and their acoustic properties. The amount of acoustic energy in a sound is measured by its sonority. A loud sound is sonorous, whereas a quiet sound is not. When singing, you hold the note on the vowels for a lengthy period.

&ensp;Consonant sounds can be voiced or voiceless. lides are an intermediate category that has some of the qualities of vowels and some of the properties of consonants. There are one or more syllables in every uttered word. A syllable is a sound that has a high level of sonority and is surrounded by sounds that have a lower level of sonority. The word ball, for example, contains the sonorous vowel sound, with two less-sonorous consonants on either side, **[b]** and **[l]**.
